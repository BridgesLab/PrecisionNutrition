title: "Cross-sectional association between blood cholesterol and calcium levels in genetically diverse strains of mice"
author: "Cody Cousineau, Kaelin Loftus, Gary A. Churchill and Dave Bridges"
format: pptx
data-notes: "We want to share some recent work our lab has done in understanding cholesterol levels.  Elevations in LDL-cholesterol cause cardiovascular disease, and is very important in preventing and treating disease.  However, separating the genetic, physiological and dietary influences of blood cholesterol in humans is difficult."

## Diversity Outbred Mice

::: {.notes}


CODY: To understand what drives blood cholesterol in mice, we evaluated diversity outbred mice and asked what explains variation in their blood cholesterol.  Diversity outbred mice are derived from the inter-breeding of eight founder strains. Each mouse is genetically unique. We used data from 840 mice, both male and female, randomized to either a control chow diet or a high fat high sucrose diet.

## What Predicts Serum Cholesterol?

::: {.notes}
CODY: We used a machine learning approach called a regression tree, inputing 162 clinical and morphological phenotypes and used these to identify what predicts serum cholesterol.

## High Fat, High Sucrose Diets Increases Cholesterol

CODY: The first predictor was the diet, with high fat high sucrose diet increasing cholesterol by 33 mg/dL.

## Serum Triglycerides and Cholesterol are Linked

:::: {.columns}

::: {.notes}
CODY: The next best predictor was serum triglycerides.  This was expected as hyperlipidemia and hypercholeserolemia are often co-morbid.

## Serum Calcium is Associated with Cholesterol

CODY To our surprise, the next predictor was serum calcium.  As you can see, a 1 mg/dL increase in serum choleserol is associated with a 12.7 mg/dL increrase in cholesterol, and this is true in male and female mice, across both diets.

DAVE or CODY: We looked into the literature and several human studies have reported positive associations between calcium and cholesterol, and between serum calcium and cardiovascular disease.  This is the first study in mice showing that this relationship is robust across diets and sexes.  While we have some hypotheses, we dont yet know whether calcium increases cholesterol, whether cholesterol increases calcium, or if something else drives both, and we look forward to studying this in the future.
